# playstation-mc-rust
Implementation of [psx_mc_cli](https://github.com/G4Vi/psx_mc_cli)'s `mcs2raw` in Rust with scaffolding for reading in other PlayStation Memory Card Image file formats.

Converts `.mcs` single save files into raw save files. See [psx-spx](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/controllersandmemorycards/#memory-card-data-format) for more detail on the memory card data format and the MCS file format.

`./test.sh` to test, the expected data was generated by the `mcs2raw` utility from [psx_mc_cli](https://github.com/G4Vi/psx_mc_cli).
